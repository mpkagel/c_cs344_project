This was an assignment in a CS344 Operating Systems course that I took at OSU to make a small shell. This program was made to run in bash,
and the small shell can run any command that can be run in bash. The small shell has its own versions of exit, cd, and status that it will
use as built-ins in place of the normal bash versions.
